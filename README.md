# COVID-19_MarkovMonteCarlo

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation for the COVID-19 epidemic.

## Simple Model:
In the simple version of MCMC simulation model we used few parameters and we are aiming to
leani epidemic curve and its evolution corresponding to civilians behaviour. 

Here are parameters considered for to describe the system: 

- $P(_t)$
